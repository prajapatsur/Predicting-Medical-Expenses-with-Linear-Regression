# Predicting-Medical-Expenses-with-Linear-Regression
This Colab notebook provides a practical and coding-focused introduction to machine learning and linear regression. It uses a real-world problem statement from ACME Insurance Inc. to guide the learning process.

# Medical Charges Prediction with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict annual medical charges for new customers of ACME Insurance Inc.

## Problem Statement

ACME Insurance Inc. wants to create an automated system to estimate the annual medical expenditure for new customers, using information such as their age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region of residence. These estimates will be used to determine the annual insurance premium offered to the customer.

## Dataset

The project uses a CSV file containing verified historical data, consisting of the aforementioned information and the actual medical charges incurred by over 1300 customers.

## Approach

The notebook uses linear regression to model the relationship between the input features and the medical charges. It explores the use of both single and multiple features, as well as categorical features.

## Results

The notebook presents the results of the linear regression models, including the predicted charges and the RMSE loss. It also visualizes the relationship between the features and the charges using various plots.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression for predicting medical charges. It also provides insights into the factors that influence medical charges, such as age, smoking habits, and BMI.

## Usage

To run the notebook, you can use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to install the required libraries:

Then, open the notebook and run the cells.
